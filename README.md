Please see the following files for submission:
1. .\SurfsUp\app.py  - Climate App Flask API
2. .\SurfsUp\climate_starter.ipynb  - Jupyter notebook for Precipitation and Station Analysis
3. .\SurfsUp\Resources\hawaii.sqlite  - SQLite database
4. .\SurfsUp\hawaii.sqlite  - Created another copy of SQLite database for the Flask API solution. I was having issues accessing the database file from the Resources folder and did not have enough time to find out the problem.
